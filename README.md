# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model
This project aims to develop a predictive model for heart disease using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes a dataset containing patient information such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant medical measurements. The primary goal is to accurately predict the presence or absence of heart disease in patients based on these input features.


Key Steps:

Explore Data: Analyze data for distributions, correlations, and missing values.
Build Models: Implement and evaluate SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and KNN models.
Compare Models: Determine the best model using accuracy metrics.
Predict: Create a user-friendly interface to predict heart disease risk.
Approach:

Load and preprocess the dataset.
Perform EDA to gain insights.
Train models using training and test splits.
Evaluate models using metrics.
Select best model.
Develop user interface.
Outcomes:

Trained heart disease prediction model.
User interface for prediction.
Model comparison results.
