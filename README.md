# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model
This project aims to develop a predictive model for heart disease using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes a dataset containing patient information such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant medical measurements. The primary goal is to accurately predict the presence or absence of heart disease in patients based on these input features.
Goals:

Data Exploration: To explore and understand the characteristics of the patient dataset, including data distributions, correlations, and missing values.
Model Development: To implement and evaluate various machine learning algorithms for heart disease prediction, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
Model Comparison: To compare the performance of different models using accuracy metrics and to identify the most effective model for the given dataset.
Prediction: To build a user-friendly interface that takes patient data as input and predicts their likelihood of having heart disease, using the best-performing model.
Overall Approach:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Load the heart disease dataset, perform necessary data cleaning, and handle any missing values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the dataset through visualizations and statistical methods to gain insights into the data and identify potential features for model training.
Feature Selection and Engineering: Select relevant features and perform feature engineering if needed to improve the model's performance.
Model Training: Train the selected machine learning models using the preprocessed dataset, split into training and testing sets.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Model Selection: Select the best-performing model for the final prediction process.
User Interface: Create a user interface to enable the user to input their information and predict the likelihood of heart disease using the best-performing model.
Expected Outcomes:

A trained and evaluated machine learning model for predicting heart disease.
A user interface for easy interaction with the model.
A comparison of the different models used with their accuracy scores.
